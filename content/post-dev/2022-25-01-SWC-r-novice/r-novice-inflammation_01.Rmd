## Fundamentals of the Lesson

*General goal*: Learn the basic concepts of programming and become a good/better programmer

The are two main aspects to becoming a good programmer: 

1) Identify the programming language that your colleagues and collaborators are using in your field, and 
2) use that language well.


The R programming language has a large and still growing user base among researchers and scientists, it is free, well documented, runs almost everywhere, and packages that add into its functionality are constantly being added.

Many learners have identified that using real data to practice and do something useful with it is the best way to learn how to use a programming language well.

*Specific goal*: learn the basics concepts of programming by analyzing data with R programming language
